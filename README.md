# Machine Learning - SF Fire Department

## Project Overview
- Dataset with thousands of fire departnment calls from years 2000-2016
- Prepare data and assemble features for ML models
- Hypertune paramters to compare and select the most accurate model.
- The libraries used were pyspark and numpy
- You can access the Jupiter Notebook at this **[LINK](https://github.com/programTristan/FireDepartment_MachineLearning/blob/main/code/TristanAppleby_SF_FireDepartmentAnalysis.ipynb)**

## Objectives 
Design an accurate machine learning model that can be used to predict future false alarms. This will help increase the efficiency of the fire department, detecting false alarms prior to expending resources.
